# 🚀 YOLOv8-Based Object Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm.  
The system detects and classifies multiple objects within an image and displays bounding boxes with confidence scores.

This project was developed as part of an AI & Data Science internship task.

## 🧠 About YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that processes an entire image in a single forward pass of the neural network.

In this project, YOLOv8 Nano (lightweight version) is used for efficient and fast object detection.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Dataset

The pretrained YOLOv8 model is trained on the COCO dataset.

COCO Dataset includes 80 object classes such as:
- Person
- Car
- Bus
- Chair
- Dog
- Laptop
- Bottle
- and more...

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

1. Install YOLOv8 using pip
2. Load pretrained YOLOv8 model
3. Upload input image
4. Perform object detection
5. Display detected objects with bounding boxes
6. Print confidence scores
7. Save output image
